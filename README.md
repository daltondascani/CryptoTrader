This application is a basic cryptocurrency trader, developed using C++ and the Qt framework, which allows the user to buy, sell, and swap any desired coin in their portfolio with the preset amount of $USDC.

This app is organized to allow the user to navigate between the different screens via the main menu. The first screen is a Buy window, which allows the user to select their desired crypto to purchase with their $USDC balance.

The second screen is a Sell window, which allows the user to select a crypto in their portfolio to sell. If the user does not have a coin in their portfolio and chooses to sell, they will encounter an error because they do not hold that coin.

The Swap window is used to allow the user to swap a coin for another, which also converts the balance to the proper amount. Once again, if the user does not have the proper amount of the coin in their portfolio, they will receive a swapping error.

Overall, this program is a great starter application to introduce the user to cryptocurrency trading. Future improvements for this project would include adding real-time market values so the portfolio has the ability to gain/lose value based off the user buying and selling for profit or losses. Additionally, more coins and potential crypto charts could be added for data-driven trading.

I hope you enjoy this program and learn how to buy, sell, and swap cryptocurrency with the CryptoTrader App!
